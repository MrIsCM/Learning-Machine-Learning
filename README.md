# Learnign Machine Learning

## Description

This is a collection of notebooks to learn Machine Learning. I am using the book _Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_ from _Aurelien Géron_.

## Notebooks

Each notebook is a chapter from the book (except for the first one). The notebooks are organized as follows:

- [Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project](Notebooks/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb)
- [Chapter 3: Classification](Notebooks/03_classification.ipynb)
- [Chapter 4: Training Linear Models](Notebooks/04_training_linear_models.ipynb)
- [Chapter 5: Support Vector Machines](Notebooks/05_support_vector_machines.ipynb)

## Exercises

My solutions to (some of) the exercises are in the [exercises](exercises) folder.

## Extra

Also, I am building some functions (that are already well implemented in Scikit-learn) from scratch to understand them better. They are in the [MyClasses](MyClasses) folder.

Currently:
- [Process Data](MyClasses/ProcessData.py): A class to process data (1 hot encoder, normalization, split data in train, test, val sets, ...).
- [Metrics](MyClasses/Metrics.py): A class to calculate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, rmse, ...).


## Acknowledgments

- [_Aurelien Géron_](https://github.com/ageron) for writing the book. I am learning a lot from it.
